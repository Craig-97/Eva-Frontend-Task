# Eva Health Technologies Frontend Task

## Overview

I have built a single page application that has styling and colours inspired by the Eva Health Technologies website and logo. 
The solution was made with responsive design in mind so works well on desktop as well as mobile and comes with both unit and API testing.

Created with the following: 
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React Testing Library (Unit Testing)](https://testing-library.com/)
- [Cypress (API Testing)](https://www.cypress.io/)

## Instructions

Make a standalone web page to create a user. We need to collect the user’s first and
last names, email address and age.

There is a GET endpoint at the same which may prove useful for testing, but note that this is
a mocked API and will return random data and data you post won’t actually be saved.
